**DD Review by The Bored**
* The design doc needs a description of what you're trying to build
* It's unclear which APIs will be used
* It's unclear how the APIs are going to be used
* Maybe explain each column of the table so you have a better idea of what it holds instead of just variable types
* Include a timeline
* Give a more specific breakdown of individual tasks
